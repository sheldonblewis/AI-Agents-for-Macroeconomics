# AI Agents for Macroeconomics: Research Plan

## Executive Summary

This research aims to develop an AI-driven agent-based model to simulate consumer behavior using demographic archetypes. By aggregating individual behaviors, we intend to predict macroeconomic activity by region and analyze the impact on large corporations and market competition. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can inform financial strategies within a 5-month timeline from December to April.

## Objectives

1. **Develop AI Agents Representing Demographic Archetypes**: Create AI agents that simulate consumer behavior based on demographic data.
2. **Simulate Macroeconomic Activity**: Use agent interactions to forecast regional economic indicators.
3. **Analyze Corporate Impact and Competition**: Assess how changes in consumer behavior affect corporate performance and competitive dynamics.
4. **Derive Financial Insights**: Generate models or formulas that can aid in investment decision-making.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection (December)

- **Demographic Data**: 
  - **Sources**: Census databases, statistical agencies.
  - **Variables**: Age, income, education, location, household size.
- **Consumer Behavior Data**:
  - **Sources**: Market research firms, transaction data.
  - **Variables**: Spending habits, brand preferences, purchasing frequency.
- **Macroeconomic Indicators**:
  - **Sources**: IMF, World Bank.
  - **Variables**: GDP growth, inflation, unemployment rates.
- **Corporate Data**:
  - **Sources**: Financial reports, market analytics.
  - **Variables**: Sales figures, market share, consumer demographics.

### 2. Agent Development (December - January)

- **Define Demographic Archetypes**: 
  - Use clustering algorithms to segment population data.
  - Develop profiles for each archetype (e.g., young professionals, families).
- **Design AI Agents**:
  - Assign behavioral rules based on economic and psychological theories.
  - Implement learning mechanisms (e.g., reinforcement learning).
  - Simulate decision-making processes influenced by social and economic factors.

### 3. Simulation Implementation (January - February)

- **Build Simulation Environment**:
  - Use platforms like AnyLogic or Mesa (Python library).
- **Run Simulations**:
  - Simulate interactions between agents and markets.
  - Model the influence of marketing, pricing, and social networks on consumer behavior.

### 4. Data Analysis (February - March)

- **Aggregate Agent Behaviors**:
  - Summarize individual actions to generate macroeconomic indicators.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Apply time-series models (ARIMA, VAR) for forecasting.
  - Conduct regression analysis to link consumer behavior with corporate performance.

### 5. Validation and Testing (March)

- **Model Calibration**:
  - Adjust parameters using historical data for accuracy.
- **Validation Techniques**:
  - **Backtesting**: Compare model predictions with historical events.
  - **Cross-Validation**: Use different data subsets to test model robustness.

### 6. Reporting and Insights (April)

- **Develop Financial Models**:
  - Create investment strategies based on simulation outcomes.
- **Prepare Documentation**:
  - Compile methodologies, findings, and recommendations.
- **Presentation**:
  - Present results to stakeholders and incorporate feedback.
